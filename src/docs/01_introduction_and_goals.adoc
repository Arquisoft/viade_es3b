== Introduction and Goals


This project is focused on developing an application to manage routes using SOLID specifications. The main objective is to ensure that users have control over their route data. For the realization of this application we will use the React framework.


=== Requirements Overview


Functional

* Users can see the routes on a map.
* Photos and videos may be shared through the application with other friends.
* Users will be able to have the data stored in their own pod
* Users may have groups of friends to share their routes.
* The application must be able to load routes generated with a different application.

No functional

* The application must have a friendly interface.
* Ease of use by non-technical people.
* Responsiveness of the application must be good.
