== Solution Strategy

Viade_es3b is a decentralized application using SOLID, it was created with the entity ruta which is the most important of all aplication to load routes and store
in SOLID PODs.
To load and store the information, it uses libraries to load and store information in SOLID PODs with Javascript language.

We used Arc42 to define the structure of the documentation and we use Asciidoctor to deploy it into an HTML to see it.

We used React to build the front-end of the application because the teacher told us to use it and is the first step to do the application more usable, which is one of the
quality attribute we wanted to perform in the application.

The interoperability of the application will be achieved using Json and load this kind of files in the POD. To achieve this objective we will follow the standard defined in https://github.com/Arquisoft/viadeSpec.

Regarding testeability: We tried to implement tests in the application because being testeable was one of the quality attributes, we di an application with 
several tests makeing it testeable in high level.

We deploy the application using github pages to increment the performance, the efficiency of the application is based on javascript calls to the Solid POD, so we tried
to do the bes in this aspect.
