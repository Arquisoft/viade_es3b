== Cross-cutting Concepts

This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts of the system.

=== Domain Model
 
==== Route

In the application , the base object we use and we modify is the object route. In the application we create objects route and we communicate this object with the user and 
POD to store and retrieve information of it. Each route  has a name,description,media,points and a comment atribute which store this in the application.

==== User
The user is the person who uses the application and can post routes and share routes with another user.

=== Architecture and desing patterns

We followed a P2P architecture because is the standard architecture of an application like this we implemented. There are only patterns in the creation of the objects of the
application, we used prototype pattern to create those objects.

=== User Experience

==== User Interface

The user interface is developed with React, we tried to do it easy to use and easy to understand to all kind of people.

==== Internationalization

The app is internationalized to be used in 2 languages, in English and Spanish for the people who can't understand English. This makes the application more usable for
all kind of people.

=== Development concepts

==== Building

To build the application we use Node.js and his package manager, we build the app with it and we use some of the features it has.

==== Testing

We have 3 types of tests in the application: +

TDD testing:: Increment the code coverage and help us to improve the application. Performed using react-testing library.
BDD testing:: to check if the application works as it should. Performed using Cucumber and jest-puppeteer.
Load testing:: Simulation of multiple users accessing the application concurrently. Performed using Gatling.


=== Security and Safety

==== Security

The application security is provided by the Solid Authentication Client and the Solid POD, if you are not authenticated in the application, you can't navigate in it.

==== Safety

No part of the system has an aspect that endangers the life of the user.

=== “Under-the-hood”

==== Persistency

The application is based on a decentralized system. Therefore, all information will be stored in each user's personal POD. It will be the user who grants the read / write permissions.

==== Transaction Handling

The transactions realized across the application are asynchronous and we managed it to prevent unfinished transactions in the application to avoid errors.

==== Session Handling

Session is handled by Solid Authentication Client, so it need an account with a SOLID Pod created and it will be handled by it.

==== Exception/Error Handling

We tried to manage exception and error handling in the code of the application.
