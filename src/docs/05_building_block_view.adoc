== Building Block View
In this section we show the static decomposition of the system into building blocks as well as their dependencies
by means of a hierarchial collection of black boxes and white boxes and their descriptions.

=== Scope & Context
White box description of the overall system together with black box descriptions of all contained building blocks.
See <<03_system_scope_and_context.adoc#section-system-scope-and-context, System Scope and Context>>

=== Level 1

At this early stage of the development process, this diagram contains as much detail as we can represent about the current view that we, the development team, have.

|======================
|Object   |Description
|Solid Pod | It will contain all the data from the given user
|Services | Provides logic to perform actions
|Interfaces | Provides user interactions with the system
|======================

=== Level 2

In this view, we have a representation of the components of the system from a standpoint of the technologies used to implement each module.

.Level 2 zooms into Service and Interface blocks of level 1

|======================
|Object   |Description
|React containers | Login, register, uploader, profile... logic
|Uploader container | Logic to upload routes, photos and videos
|Map container | Logic to manage the leaflet Map
|New Route container | Logic to create and store routes
|Friend container | Logic to manage friends and get their solid name and public routes basic info
|React components | Login, register, uploader, profile... interfaces
|Uploader component | Interface to upload routes, photos and videos
|Map component | Interface that displays private or shared routes
|New Route component | Interface to create routes and upload photos and videos
|Friend component | Interface to manage friends and get their solid name and public routes basic info
|======================

.Motivation
This separations of the system's parts was accomplished in order to give the development team a clearer view of how the information of the project's subject was going to be spread, and also to allow them to focus on single areas of software technology to ease the soon to come implementation task.
